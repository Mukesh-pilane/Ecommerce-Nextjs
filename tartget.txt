1. Create a small e-commerce website with a dummy payment system (you are free to take
assumptions in this project).
2. The website should have pages: Home, Products and Cart.
3. The Home page should display all the product items currently available, with their name
and price.
4. Clicking on any product card in the Home page should redirect to that product's single
page, where you can see a description about the product and a link to purchase it.
5. The product single page should also show the number of previous orders and set a limit
on the number of products that can be sold (this must be stored in local storage). When
all products are sold, make the item unavailable. If items are available, give two options:
add to cart and buy now.
6. The Purchase List page should show all the items that have been purchased. There can
be an extra option to cancel purchases (optional).
7. The Cart page should show all the items that have been added to the cart. Here, you
can purchase the item or remove it from the cart.
8. The website should have a navbar to navigate between the different pages.
9. Once you have finished building the website, launch it on Firebase.
10. You are free to add any additional features. Weâ€™ll be happy to see creativity
